 # Brief Description of the project

You are required to develop a JsonPowerDB tool which eases the data navigation, addition, modification and removal of data or records in the database. This will help developers in development as well as debugging their application.

There are 4 pages to be developed:

    Home Page: That will allow the user / developer to enter his token.
    Table Page: That will display data of selected relation (table) of selected database and allows user / developer to:
            Easily navigate, add, modify and remove records in relation.
            Provide data to export in different formats like CSV, Excel, PDF.
            Allow users to print the table data on the printer.
            Search option to filter records based on search key.

    Form Page: A data entry form with full navigation control buttons.
    Filter Page (optional): To filter out records in 'Table' by applying conditions
