# JsonPowerDB

<h2>"The Following Internship is all about Introduction to JsonPowerDB(JPBD) And How to Use JPDB."</h2>
<h3> Technical Induction </h3>
<p>The Technical Induction Program aims at preparing candidates to use JsonPowerDB confidently in their applications. The program will cover following topics / features of the JsonPowerDB:</p>
<ul>
   <li> Using Document Oriented DBMS commands.</li>
    <li> How to use Dynamic RDBMS commands while developing web applications.</li>
    <li> Effective use of JSONPowerSQL .</li>
    <li> The concept of True Serverless application development.</li>
    <li> Frontend Web Technologies.</li>
    <li> Creating Desktop applications using Web Technologies.</li>
</ul>
<h2> About JsonPowerDB: </h2>
<p>JsonPowerDB is a Database Server with Developer friendly REST API services. It's a High Performance, Light Weight, Ajax Enabled, Serverless, Simple to Use, Real-time Database.

Easy and fast to develop database applications without using any server side programming / scripting or without installing any kind of database.

Whether it's a Dynamic Website or a Mobile App or some Data Analytics Portal, the development is real fun and fast. Nothing better than trying it yourself. What all you need is a basic understanding of HTML, CSS, Bootstrap, and Javascript.</p>
<h2>Uses of JsonPowerDB</h2>
<ul>
<li>All Mobile applications that require backend database.</li>
<li>Session Caching.</li>
<li>Page Caching.</li>
<li>Existing Database applications to improve their reporting / analytics performance.</li>
<li>Best suited as backend Database for IoT.</li>
<li>Live HTML templates / themes.</li>
<li>Any software application that needs backend database.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Benefits of Using JsonPowerDB</h2>
<ul>
<li>Proprietary algorithm for High Performance CRUD operations. Multiple times faster than popular DBMS.</li>
<li>Serverless support for faster development - A UI developer can develop complete dynamic application.</li>
<li>DBMS with built in web / application server and embedded caching makes the performance lightning fast.</li>
<li>Enriched by a pluggable API Framework - A developer can develop a pluggable API and plugin into any of our cloud JPDB instance.</li>
<li>Nimble, Simple to use, In Memory, Real-time DBMS.</li>
<li>Web-services API - Can be used with any programming language that has support for HTTP.</li>
<li>Multiple security layers.</li></ul>
<h2>Induction Prerequisite</h2>
<ul>
   <li>HTML Knowledge </li>
   <li>CSS Knowledge</li>
   <li> Javascript Knowledge</li>
   <li>JQuery Knowledge</li>
   <li> BootStrap Knowledge</li>
 </ul>
 <h2>Using JsonPowerDB - The Serveless Way</h2>
 <p>JsonPowerDB advocates for Serverless development by eliminating the need of intermediate programming languages like Python / PHP / Java / .NET etc. In turn this will improve the performance of your application by reducing a cycle of latency. It does not mean that you can't use it with these programming languages.<br>
             It is even easier to use it with Python/ PHP / Java / .NET or any programming language. You are not required to install any driver / plugin to connect to JsonPowerDB which you normally require to connect to other DBMS. The reason behind this is JsonPowerDB is natively HTTP Rest API based JSON document oriented DBMS.</p>
         <h3> Project Done: Employee Form with Navigation and more Control Buttons </h3>
         <p>You are required to complete the following exercise using HTML, JavaScript and Bootstrap.
    Create an employee form.<br>
   The form has different navigation buttons available to navigate through the form : [First,  Previous, Next, Last] records, and different control buttons to perform different operation on the form : [New, Save, Edit, Change, Reset].
</p>
<h2> Session Management Using JsonPowerDB </h2>
<h3> Project Done : HR Admin DashBoard </h3>
<p>HR Admin Dashboard - Making all the functionality working in all the pages and learning session management using local storage.

          Make functionality of each loggedIn and loggedOut pages by connecting it with JsonPowerDB.
Confirm that employee form is same as created in Full navigation with Controls.
For forget password page send random password through email by using the function createEmailToSendReq() to create request and use executeCommand() to execute the request  from jpdb-commons.js </p>
<h2> More Useful JPDB Commands </h2>
<p> Practice some useful commands of JPDB. It will help you to complete the test.

Run all the commands in talend and save all the commands you run.

Topics for self learning:

 1. IML (JPDB Index Manipulation Language) - To insert, update and delete Json data.

 2. IRL (JPDB Index Retrieval Language) - To retrieve Json data.

 3. IDL (JPDB Index Definition Language) - To add index column and remove column / relation / database.

 4. Serverless API - To send email, getting unique id and for maintaining session.

 5. JsonPower Query - To retrieve data from database.
